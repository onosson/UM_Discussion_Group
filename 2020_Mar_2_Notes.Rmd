# How to make a personal academic website{-}

# The single-page version

*Simple, easy to manage...*

## GitHub Pages

* This is where your page will be hosted
* https://pages.github.com/

## GitHub

* This is where the source for your page will be hosted
* https://github.com/
* Once you have an account, you can manage other code repositories on GitHub

## Steps to make a GitHub Page

1. create an account (free version) at https://github.com/
1. verify your account (check your email)
1. create a new repository 
    * make sure the name is identical with your username
    * be sure to check the box to initialize the repository with a README
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    include_graphics("images/newreponame.png")
    ```
1. edit the README by clicking the pencil icon
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    include_graphics("images/edit1.png")
    ```
1. enter the information you want on your page
    * all (?) Markdown code elements are valid
    * you can preview the file as you work
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    include_graphics("images/edit2.png")
    ```
1. commit changes when you are done - this updates the file
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    include_graphics("images/commit.png")
    ```
1. go to the repository's settings
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    include_graphics("images/settings.png")
    ```
1. scroll down to the GitHub Pages section
    * change the Source to the **master branch**
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    include_graphics("images/master.png")
    ```
    * click the button to Choose a Theme for your page (this can be changed at any time)
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    include_graphics("images/theme.png")
    ```
    * select your theme from the choices available
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    include_graphics("images/select.png")
    ```
1. scroll down to the GitHub Pages section again to find the link to your GitHub Page
    * the link will always be: http://USERNAME.github.io/USERNAME/
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    include_graphics("images/link.png")
    include_graphics("images/page.png")
    ```

That's it! You can use any R Markdown code in your page, *and* edit it directly in your browser at any time via the README.md file



# The multi-page version

*Complex, flexible, management involves more coding*
