Welcome to the home of the **Coding for Linguistics Discussion Group** at the Linguistics Department of the University of Manitoba:

* Meetings will be based around discussing various aspects of the use of code-based software such as R, Praat, and LaTeX in linguistic research
* To join our mailing list so that you are notified of upcoming meeting dates and agendas, please send an email to: <sky@onosson.com>

# Upcoming meeting on April 6th

This meeting will focus on a number of advance and/or focused topics involving R. Selection of topics is currently preliminary, but may tentatively include:

* good practice in managing your projects, including R scripts etc.
* writing custom functions

# Meeting agendas and notes

There are two wasy to get the notes and other materials for each meeting:

1. **Clone or download** this repository (<https://github.com/onosson/UM_Discussion_Group>) on the morning before our meetings -- I tend to make changes very late, so the morning of the meeting itself is the best time to do so!
    * click on the `Clone or download` button near the top of the repository page
    * download the repository as a .zip file
    * unzip it on your computer to the location of your choosing
    * open the **UM_Discussion_Group.Rproj** file
1. Alternatively, you can view each day's notes as a webpage via the links in the **Notes** column in the **Schedule** above -- depending on the topic, it may be easier to simply follow along that way, rather than working with the code directly
    * the Notes pages may take a minute or two to load the first time - if you just see a blank page in your browser, wait a moment and it should appear
