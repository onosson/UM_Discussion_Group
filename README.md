Welcome to the home of the **Coding for Linguistics Discussion Group** at the Linguistics Department of the University of Manitoba:

* Meetings will be based around discussing various aspects of the use of code-based software such as R, Praat, and LaTeX in linguistic research
* To join our mailing list please send an email to: <sky@onosson.com>

Please **clone or download** this repository on the morning before our meetings, and you will have any updates which we may be discussing - I tend to make changes very late, so the morning of the meeting itself is the best time to do so!

# Agenda: March 2

For March 2nd we will be looking at building a website in R Markdown. I'm planning to show you how to connect RStudio with <https://pages.github.com/> where your site can be hosted (for free) if you choose to do so, so it would be helpful if everyone can set up a GitHub account beforehand just to get that out of the way - just go to <http://github.com> and create an account.

# Resources

The main code & files which I will bring to our meetings can be found here (including files from previous dates): <https://github.com/onosson/UM_Discussion_Group>

1. download that repository as a .zip file
1. unzip it
1. open the **UM_Discussion_Group.Rproj** file

Below are sets of resources on a variety of coding and related topics which you may find useful, divided according to type. I will try to update this list frequently.
